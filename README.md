This is my blog content, written in Markdown, Pelican configuration files, and customized theme for my website, mathamy.com.

For more information on how I set up my website using GitHub Pages and Pelican, see this [blog post](http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html).

The static HTML generated by Pelican is contained in my [amygdalama.github.io](https://github.com/amygdalama/amygdalama.github.io) repo.
