I love broken things, unfinished things, breaking things, unfinishing things. Broken and unfinished things allow you to see the process in which they were created; their most intimate secrets are exposed.

##Broken Statues

A week ago, inside [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](http://www.metmuseum.org/en), my love for broken things was realized. Just *look* at these. They're so *naked, vulnerable*.

Okay so some of them are literally naked, but you get the point. When a statue is broken, you can sneak a peek inside! You get so many clues about how it was made! Is it hollow? What's it made out of? Is the material on the outside the same as the inside? Does it have a frame?

##Breaking Code

While I can't bring myself to break art to get clues about the process of its creation, I *can* break code! Breaking code is free and doesn't hurt anyone! I do this quite a bit as a method of learning - removing the pieces of code that you don't understand reveals the purpose of those pieces. It's like removing the arm of a statue to look inside.

Let's look at some code from Mary Rose Cook's functional programming [tutorial](http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming) (which is amazing, and you should absolutely read it and do the exercises and spend time understanding it completely if you're at all interested in functional programming). We won't understand the code at first (or at least *I* won't), but we'll take apart the pieces of the code in attempt to understand their purpose better.
