##Replacing `import` with `accio`: Compiling Pythons with Custom Grammar for the sake of a joke!

In Python, overwriting builtin functions is fairly easy. You can even do it in the interpreter! But can you overwrite a statement, like import, just as easily? Let's go on an adventure, discovering how the import statement works, and how Python statements are defined in the CPython source code. We'll face some consequences of bootstrapping, and, to get our custom Harry Potter-themed Grammar to work, we'll have to compile a Python to compile a Python.

Here's the [full proposal](https://github.com/amygdalama/talks/blob/master/nagini/proposal.md) and here are the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/AmyHanlon/replacing-import-with-accio), which are still a bit of a work-in-progress.

I've given this talk at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/), [NYC PyLadies](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-PyLadies/), and [NYC Hack and Tell](http://www.meetup.com/hack-and-tell/). I've also submitted it to [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/), [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org/), and [PyOhio](http://www.pyohio.org/).
