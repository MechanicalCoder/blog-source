Hi, I'm Amy.
===============
I'm in the W'14 batch at [Hacker School], where I've worked on projects like [creating sounds from spectrograms](https://github.com/amygdalama/furrier-transform) (huge failure) and [replacing Python builtins and keywords with Harry Potter spells](https://github.com/amygdalama/nagini) (huge success).

My background is in Theoretical Math. After college I optimized paid search ads for Adam & Eve, so I basically used to sell, ehem, Adult Products on the internet (though my employer was [Adlucent], an agency in Austin, TX). I then used machine learning via [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to automate tasks like classification of search queries into product categories.

I will nerd out with you about programming, science fiction, feminism, comics, Dune (I <3 Dune. Dune, Dune, Dune.), math, board games, etc. I also think it's fabulous to drink champagne in bed.
