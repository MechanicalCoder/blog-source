I'm a Software Engineer on [Venmo](https://venmo.com/)'s Scaling team in New York City, where I've been working on projects like migrating data from MySQL to Cassandra.

I'm also a [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) alum, where I compiled a Harry Potter-themed Python interpreter and converted a picture of my cat to sound.

Previously I studied pure math and did some data analysis and machine learning in Austin, TX.

I love teaching programming, playing board games, and reading Dune.
