I'm a software engineer on [Venmo](https://venmo.com/)'s Scaling team in New York City.

I'm also a ~~Hacker School~~ [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) alum, where I compiled a Harry Potter-themed Python interpreter and converted a picture of my cat to sound.

Previously I studied pure math and did some data analysis and machine learning in Austin, TX.
