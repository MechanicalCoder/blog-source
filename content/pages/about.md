I'm a Software Engineer based in Brooklyn.

I recently attended [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/), where I worked on projects like compiling a Harry Potter-themed Python interpreter and converting a picture of my cat to sound.

Previously I studied pure math and did some data analysis and machine learning in Austin, TX.

I love teaching programming, playing board games, and reading Dune.
