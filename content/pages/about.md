I'm in the W'14 batch at [Hacker School], where my main focus is to learn Python intimately well. See my [Projects](http://mathamy.com/pages/projects.html) page for details on what I've been working on.

My background is in Theoretical Math. After college I optimized paid search ads for Adam & Eve, so I basically used to sell, ehem, Adult Products on the internet (though my employer was [Adlucent], an agency in Austin, TX). I then used machine learning via [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to automate tasks like classification of search queries into product categories.

I will nerd out with you about programming, science fiction, feminism, comics, Dune (I <3 Dune. Dune, Dune, Dune.), math, and board games. I also think it's fabulous to drink champagne in bed.
