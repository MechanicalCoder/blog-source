Ideas for future posts:

* Furrier Transforms: A Journey that ends in failure
    (has a file already)
* My Personality is Open Source
    On how over the years I've learned to emulate characteristics of people that I like and how I welcome others to emulate me
    git clone, git fork, git merge, pull requests, etc
* How To Learn Programming Series
    I've covered the meta - now let's talk how to actually do it
    * git - learn git! make your code publicly available! use git every chance you can get!
    * contribute to open source - it's not as hard as it sounds! look for bugs/changes that can be made that the owner of the project would consider a nice-to-have (not essential) but just doesn't have time to fix themselves
    * some really good books and resources - LPTHW, Dive into Python, but stop reading them if you get bored!
* What is the difference between a Python Expression vs a Statement
* Class attributes wtf, also you can put code directly in a class outside of any function in the class
* What is testing, really. And how do you do it.
* What is Hacker School
* How was Hacker School
* Iron Forger: A Retrospective
    * The Lazy Dictator Model
* How I Prepared for Interviews
* Writing a brainfuck interpreter
* Creating a chat server
* Things to do on bad days
    * Help someone with something
    * Sit in the park
    * Do mundane work that needs to get done and is possible to do from your bed, under your blankets, like calling the bank, etc
    * Take a bath
    * Get a massage
