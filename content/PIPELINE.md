Ideas for future posts:

* Furrier Transforms: A Journey that ends in failure
    (has a file already)
* My Personality is Open Source
    On how over the years I've learned to emulate characteristics of people that I like and how I welcome others to emulate me
    git clone, git fork, git merge, pull requests, etc
* How To Learn Programming Series
    I've covered the meta - now let's talk how to actually do it
    * git - learn git! make your code publicly available! use git every chance you can get!
    * contribute to open source - it's not as hard as it sounds! look for bugs/changes that can be made that the owner of the project would consider a nice-to-have (not essential) but just doesn't have time to fix themselves
    * some really good books and resources - LPTHW, Dive into Python, but stop reading them if you get bored!
* What is the difference between a Python Expression vs a Statement
* Class attributes wtf, also you can put code directly in a class outside of any function in the class
* Figuring out tests - how to see if nose.tools.assert_raises(Exception, callable, args) actually executes the callable (i.e. if the callable causes side-effects usually, can you just check to see if the side effects happened immediately after the assert_rases statement?) To test - make the thing that you're assert_raise-ing create side effects, and then check to see if the side effects happened or not. (see phonebook tests.py script for details)
